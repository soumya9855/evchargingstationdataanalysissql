# evchargingstation data analysis using sql


### Project Overview:
The project involves designing and querying an SQL database for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. The database stores critical details about each charging station, including its location, charging capacity, availability, operator, cost per kWh, and other relevant attributes. The project aims to facilitate data retrieval and analysis to improve EV infrastructure planning and enhance user experience.

### Project Objectives:
1. Efficient Data Storage: Create a structured database schema to store EV charging station details, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.
2. Performance Optimization: Implement indexing and optimized queries to enhance data access speed.
3. Data Analysis and Insights: Develop SQL queries to extract key insights, such as the most frequently used stations, cost-effective locations, and stations with the highest charging capacity.
4. Renewable Energy Integration: Identify charging stations that operate on renewable energy sources.
5. User Experience Enhancement: Provide insights on station availability, connector types, and charging costs to help EV users make informed decisions.
